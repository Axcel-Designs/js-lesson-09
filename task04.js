// Task 4: Create an asynchronous function that fetches and returns data from a free weather API. Use the data to dynamically populate a simple UI. You are to use only three core values from the weather API to populate your UI. The design of the UI depends on the weather API youâ€™d be using. Apply try/catch in your algorithm. If the request is not successful, display a failure message to the user. Make your UI responsive.
