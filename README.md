Task 1: Define an arrow function that takes four arguments: date of birth(DOB), year,name, and location. The function should calculate the user’s age. Using template literal,dynamically display the “Hello name(user’s name) from (location), your current age is (age) and return the age.

Task 2: Define a “userBio” object with the following properties: occupation, height, gender, and nationality. Using object destructuring, get “gender” and “occupation” from the object.  Use template literals to make a statement that displays the user’s gender and occupation. Call the function three times with three different users.

Task 3: Create an array of objects of length 4. Each object should have the following properties: firstName, lastName, complexion, and occupation. Loop through the array, for each item, display the user’s info in a separate div created dynamically.

Task 4: Create an asynchronous function that fetches and returns data from a free weather API. Use the data to dynamically populate a simple UI. You are to use only three core values from the weather API to populate your UI. The design of the UI depends on the weather API you’d be using. Apply try/catch in your algorithm. If the request is not successful, display a failure message to the user. Make your UI responsive.
